# hello-world
time honored tradition

It has been a year since I have created this account.  Since then I've done nothing because I was a noob that just moved into my company's IT department with no real developer skill set.  Now, it is a great feeling to come back with the knowledge that I've obtained over the course of a year.  I am excited to start playing around and code on my own machine at home.
